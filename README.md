# README.md Generator

## Description
The goal of this project is for students to code an index.js file with the code necessary to write a README.md file using data gathered from terminal prompts. Students use their existing knowledge of javascript, while introducing new knowledge of node to make this application work.

## Installation

This project requires fs and inquirer to properly run. Typing 'npm i inquirer@^8.2.4' and 'npm i fs' in the terminal should install these packages to your personal repository.

## Usage

After cloning the repository to your personal device and installing fs and inquirer, type 'node index.js' into your terminal. The application will ask you a series of questions, which you will type in your response in the terminal. After all questions are answered, a README.md file will generate using the answers you provided. If there is already a README file, it will be overwritten with the new data.
